###Scope of the assignment

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!
```{r}
library(leaflet)
```

```{r}
my_map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  
  addMarkers(lng=-4.78, lat=37.879, popup= "Big Mosque of Cordoba, One of my preferable places, visited in 2015.")
my_map

```
